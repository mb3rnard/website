## Who are we

Manala is a side project, lead by the french web agency [ELAO](https://www.elao.com).
We are familiar of custom made applications with critical impacts, specialists of PHP environments in particular [Symfony](http://symfony.com)

Our customers comes from big companies with needs of critical softwares to promising start-up with big technical challenges.

## Why Manala ?

Manala is born from the assessment that itâ€™s become very difficult to keep a local environment up to date when you are working on very different projects.
Moderns IT projects brings to developpers a lot of complexity with several technical challenges (Backend / Frontend / API / Micro-services ...) with their own technical solutions (PHP, Angular, Ember, Python ... )

Add to this the need to have different versions running at the same time and you have a pretty brain-teaser.

Our initial goals were:

* Quickly bootstrap a new project (We don't have time to lose to setup a local environment)
* Allow developers to be independent without a sharp knowledge of linux administration.
* Stay as close as possible of our production environments.
* Keep the availability to be very precise on the configuration of complex infrastructures (Clustering, HA ... ).

## What is this name ?

Long story short, Manala is a traditional milk breads, littleman shaped, with chocolate chip or raisin, coming from east of France and Germany. They are baked for Saint Nicholas Day.

Don't ask why we have chosen it, as we are not ourself sure to remember...
